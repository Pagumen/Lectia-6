        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio; the
          seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison. When Edison was
          seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here
          until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very
          little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few
          months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother,
          but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading
          on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time. At
          thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on
          the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to
          have spent much of his free time reading scientific, and technical
          books, and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to
          operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient
          enough to work as a telegrapher full time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development of the telegraph was the first step in the
          communication revolution, and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly
          in the second half of the 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison
          and others like him a chance to travel, see the country, and gain
          experience. Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United
          States before arriving in Boston in 1868. Here Edison began to change
          his profession from telegrapher to inventor. He received his first
          patent on an electric vote recorder, a device intended for use by
          elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process. This
          invention was a commercial failure. Edison resolved that in the future
          he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edison moved to New York City in 1869. He continued to work on
          inventions related to the telegraph, and developed his first
          successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the "Universal
          Stock Printer". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid
          $40,000. This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first
          small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey in
          1871. During the next five years, Edison worked in Newark inventing
          and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and
          efficiency of the telegraph. He also found to time to get married to
          Mary Stilwell and start a family.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved
          his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park,
          twenty-five miles southwest of New York City. Edison established a new
          facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any
          invention. This research and development laboratory was the first of
          its kind anywhere; the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell
          Laboratories, this is sometimes considered to be Edison's greatest
          invention. Here Edison began to change the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the
          tin foil phonograph. The first machine that could record and reproduce
          sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame.
          Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph, and was
          invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford
          B. Hayes in April 1878.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edison next undertook his greatest challenge, the development of a
          practical incandescent, electric light. The idea of electric lighting
          was not new, and a number of people had worked on, and even developed
          forms of electric lighting. But up to that time, nothing had been
          developed that was remotely practical for home use. Edison's eventual
          achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light, but
          also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements
          necessary to make the incandescent light practical, safe, and
          economical. After one and a half years of work, success was achieved
          when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread
          burned for thirteen and a half hours. The first public demonstration
          of the Edison's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879,
          when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted.
          Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry. In
          September 1882, the first commercial power station, located on Pearl
          Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and
          power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had
          begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of
          fame and wealth, as electricity spread around the world. Edison's
          various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were
          brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite the use of
          Edison in the company title however, Edison never controlled this
          company. The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the
          incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of
          investment bankers such as J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric
          merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston in 1892, Edison
          was dropped from the name, and the company became simply General
          Electric.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period of success was marred by the death of Edison's wife Mary
          in 1884. Edison's involvement in the business end of the electric
          industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park. After
          Mary's death, Edison was there even less, living instead in New York
          City with his three children. A year later, while vacationing at a
          friends house in New England, Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love.
          The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange, New
          Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate, Glenmont, for his bride.
          Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Edison moved to West Orange, he was doing experimental work in
          makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison,
          New Jersey. A few months after his marriage, however, Edison decided
          to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself, less than a mile from
          his home. Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this
          time to build, "the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and
          the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development
          of an invention ". The new laboratory complex consisting of five
          buildings opened in November 1887. A three story main laboratory
          building contained a power plant, machine shops, stock rooms,
          experimental rooms and a large library. Four smaller one story
          buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics
          lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, and chemical
          storage. The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to
          work on any sort of project, but also allowed him to work on as many
          as ten or twenty projects at once. Facilities were added to the
          laboratory or modified to meet Edison's changing needs as he continued
          to work in this complex until his death in 1931. Over the years,
          factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the
          laboratory. The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually
          covered more than twenty acres and employed 10,000 people at its peak
          during World War One (1914-1918).

        <h2>Curiosities</h2>
        <h3>Edison created a battery for electric cars</h3>
        <p>
          In 1901, Edison created a nickel-alkaline battery that he thought
          would be better than the current batteries on the market. His goal was
          to use the battery for electric vehicles. Unfortunately for Edison, a
          few years after he created the battery, the manufacturers stopped
          producing electric vehicles. At the beginning of the twentieth
          century, Thomas Edison already had a small factory for the production
          of electric cars. In fact, by 1912, there were more than 33,000
          electric cars on American roads. Many of them were luxuriously
          equipped, similar to today's high-end vehicles. Detroit Electric thus
          offered its customers the ability to design the interior themselves -
          similar to many of today's luxury vehicle manufacturers. However, the
          first electric cars were considered slow even for early 20th century
          standards, and they could only travel up to thirty kilometers before
          the batteries ran out.
        </p>
        <h3>Edison's first patent was for a vote recorder</h3>
        <p>
          One of the first steps in the communication revolution was the
          development of the telegraph. The telegraph industry rapidly expanded
          in the 19th century, and as an operator of the telegraph, this rapid
          growth gave Edison a chance to travel around the United States. He had
          worked in many cities across the US before he arrived in Boston. In
          this city is when Edison decided that rather than a telegraph
          operator, he would be an inventor. His first patent was an
          “Electrographic Vote Recorder and Register”, a device designed to
          speed up the voting process in Congress. Unfortunately for him, this
          device was a failure; members of Congress were not impressed at the
          speed at which the machine recorded votes. After this, Edison decided
          that in the future he would only create things that he was confident
          the public would want.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Thomas Edison saved a three-year-old boy from getting hit by a train
        </h3>
        <p>
          At 12-years-old Edison started compiling his own weekly newspaper
          which he started selling on the train along with candy and magazines.
          A few years into his career as a newspaper creator and seller, in
          August 1862, he saw a two-year-old boy called Jimmie Mackenzie about
          to get hit by a train. Edison reacted quickly, saving the little boy's
          life and receiving only minor wounds. James U. Mackenzie, the station
          master, and father of Jimmie, was so grateful for what Thomas Edison
          had done, he offered to teach him how to use a telegraph, which would
          end up changing his life forever.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Thomas Edison suggested using the word “hello” as a telephone greeting
        </h3>
        <p>
          We all answer the phone with “hello”, but that wasn't always the case.
          Before hello was widely used when answering the telephone, people used
          to pick up, saying phrases like, “Are you there?” and “Do I get you?”.
          Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, suggested using
          the phrase “Ahoy” when answering the phone. However, Thomas Edison,
          who had a rivalry with Alexander Graham Bell, was the first person to
          be documented suggesting the word “hello” as a greeting when picking
          up the telephone. In 1877, Edison wrote to T.B.A. David, President of
          the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburg:
          “Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can
          be heard 10 to 20 feet away. What you think? Edison - P.S. first cost
          of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.”
        </p>
        <h3>Nikola Tesla worked for Thomas Edison</h3>
        <p>
          Nikola Tesla, the world-renowned inventor, first started working for
          an Edison company in 1882, when he joined the Continental Edison
          Company in Paris, France. Here Tesla gained a reputation for being
          highly skilled and when the manager overseeing the Paris company,
          Charles Batchelor, returned to the United States, he requested that
          Tesla join him. Tesla only worked for the US-based Edison Machine
          Works for around 6 months before quitting for unknown reasons. In the
          time he worked there, he only met Thomas Edison a couple of times. In
          one of these meetings, Edison called Tesla “a damned good man”.
